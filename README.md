## About

As described by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code),

> [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar).


## Tech
- [Vim Text Editor](https://www.vim.org/)

- [Python 3.6 using WSL2 Ubuntu 18.04](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) - Written in Java™ SE Development Kit 11.0.9 (JDK 11.0.9)

- [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) - Java IDE

## Notes
- I have tried to present different solutions in Java and in python.
- Some of the solutions are not the best in terms of either time or space complexity. However, I have tried to refactor them.
- Some of the folders may have a separate README.md which explains a gist of the solutions implemented.
