## About

As described by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code),

> [**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar).


## Tech
C is still the king!
I LOVE C programming due to its simplicity and elegance. So, I plan to use C mostly with a little Python, C++ and Golang sprinked in!
- [Emacs Text Editor](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

## Notes
- I have tried to present different solutions in Java and in python.
- Some of the solutions are not the best in terms of either time or space complexity. However, I have tried to refactor them.
- Some of the folders may have a separate README.md which explains a gist of the solutions implemented.
