1.  
    Once an amphipod stops moving in the hallway, it will stay in that spot until it can move into a room.
    (That is , once any amphipod starts moving,
    any other amphipods currently in the hallway are locked in place
    and will not move again until they can move fully into a room.)
    can someone explain this, i think this is where im going wrong but im not sure
    does it mean that amphipods cant move from one position in the hallway to another
    yes
    you can only move room -> room, room -> hallway, hallway -> room
    you cannot move hallway -> hallway
    basically, each amphipod can only make up to 2 moves, ever
    out to the hall -> to the final place it needs to be
    it can't do anything else
    i always move room->hall and hall->room
    simplifies it
    each pod can only ever make at most 2 moves.
    one out of the room to the hall, one from the hall to he room in their final spot
    nothing else

        if all(in_correct_room(pod) for pod in grid.pods):
            return 0
        lowest = float('inf')
        for i, pod in enumerate(grid.pods):
            char, (row, col) = pod
            for (nrow, ncol) in grid.available_spots_for(pod):
                step_cost = (abs(nrow-row) + abs(ncol-col)) * COST[char]
                grid.pods[i] = (char, (nrow, ncol))
                rec_cost = solve(grid)

                if rec_cost + step_cost < lowest:
                    lowest = rec_cost + step_cost
        return lowest
    simple backtracking really
3.  
    dijkstra = a* but heuristic 0
4.  
    modular arithmetic is hard, i don't blame people
    i only know because i have been burned too often
    I found just putting input() right when the function is called and printing the grid super helpful
